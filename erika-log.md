# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning JQuery in more detail for FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Generator Project

**Thoughts:** I figured out how to style and make the quote generator fairly easily with html and css, but needed a little help from a tutorial for the full functionality of the quote button. I figured out how to select a quote and its respective author on my own, but was fuzzy on randomizing the selection. This shows me that I still need to work on algorithms. I plan to get enough JQuery under my belt to make the tweet button work on my quote generator.

### Day 2: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued to read up on JQuery, completed FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Generator project!

**Thoughts:** I went through tons of documentation and forum posts to tweak and edit my quote generator. I had an issue with the tweet button in particular. It would either show a blank tweet form or a copy of my quote generator codepen page. So frustrating! I finally got the project where I want it, and the tweet button now produces the quote and who said it in the twitter form. So stoked! This was a huge challenge, and I tried so hard not to get discouraged, though I started to get bummed out just before my breakthrough with fixing my bugs.

### Day 3: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started on Weather App FreeCodeCamp Project

**Thoughts:** I did a lot of reading today to try to wrap my head around APIs: what they are, how they work, how to use them, etc. I also started laying in the framework for the app, deciding what information to include, etc. It's amazing how quickly I forgot how tedious it is to set up the html & css even though I did the same thing when I started on my quote generator around a week ago. I felt pretty distracted tonight (just made a 4+ hour drive to visit family for Thanksgiving), so I wasn't super productive, but at least I know what I want to tackle tomorrow.
