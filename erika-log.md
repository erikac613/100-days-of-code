# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning JQuery in more detail for FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Generator Project

**Thoughts:** I figured out how to style and make the quote generator fairly easily with html and css, but needed a little help from a tutorial for the full functionality of the quote button. I figured out how to select a quote and its respective author on my own, but was fuzzy on randomizing the selection. This shows me that I still need to work on algorithms. I plan to get enough JQuery under my belt to make the tweet button work on my quote generator.

### Day 2: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued to read up on JQuery, completed FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Generator project!

**Thoughts:** I went through tons of documentation and forum posts to tweak and edit my quote generator. I had an issue with the tweet button in particular. It would either show a blank tweet form or a copy of my quote generator codepen page. So frustrating! I finally got the project where I want it, and the tweet button now produces the quote and who said it in the twitter form. So stoked! This was a huge challenge, and I tried so hard not to get discouraged, though I started to get bummed out just before my breakthrough with fixing my bugs.

### Day 3: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started on Weather App FreeCodeCamp Project

**Thoughts:** I did a lot of reading today to try to wrap my head around APIs: what they are, how they work, how to use them, etc. I also started laying in the framework for the app, deciding what information to include, etc. It's amazing how quickly I forgot how tedious it is to set up the html & css even though I did the same thing when I started on my quote generator around a week ago. I felt pretty distracted tonight (just made a 4+ hour drive to visit family for Thanksgiving), so I wasn't super productive, but at least I know what I want to tackle tomorrow.

### Day 4: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Connected FCC weather app to API, did a little tweaking of my portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Today, I applied some of the things I've been learning about using Bootstrap to the work I did on my FCC portfolio page weeks ago. I keep having these little "a-ha!" moments when I realize I now know a better way to do something I was struggling with previously. Those little signs of progress are so helpful and show me I'm learning bit by bit. Most of today as spent reading up on how to use JQuery to access APIs. This feels like a project where I'll have to steel myself and push forward a little at a time.

### Day 5: November 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting API data to display in weather app

**Thoughts:** Getting the API data to display properly in my weather app is one of the hardest things I've done with programming so far. I am taking advantage of all the tutorials and resources on the subject that I can find. This is a slow go, but each time I get something to work, even if it's still not quite right, it is so exciting and makes me want to keep working.

### Day 6: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about reverse geocoding, worked on some CodeWars Kata

**Thoughts:** I read a little bit about some of the steps I need to take to get my weather app working, but I was so tired today when I sat down to code. I ended up spending my time working on some CodeWars kata so I could feel like I was actually accomplishing something. It felt good to get a little bit done. I think my time will be better spent working on some JQuery and AJAX related tutorials the next few days.
