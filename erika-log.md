# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning JQuery in more detail for FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Generator Project

**Thoughts:** I figured out how to style and make the quote generator fairly easily with html and css, but needed a little help from a tutorial for the full functionality of the quote button. I figured out how to select a quote and its respective author on my own, but was fuzzy on randomizing the selection. This shows me that I still need to work on algorithms. I plan to get enough JQuery under my belt to make the tweet button work on my quote generator.
